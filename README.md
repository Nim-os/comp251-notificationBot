# comp251-notificationBot
Notificiation Bot for COMP251 at McGill University so that I am notified whenever a new message is posted.

## Why?
Because I don't want to be in the dark for when this legend posts his messages to the public.

## What to do
Run botScript.sh in your terminal and leave it running in the background.
It will notify you every 2 hours (Changeable within botScript.sh) if there is a new message or not.
