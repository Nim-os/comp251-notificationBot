# comp251-notificationBot
Notificiation bot for COMP251 at McGill University so that I am notified whenever a new message is posted.
Inspiration drawn from 303_Texter by Gaurav Karna at https://github.com/gaurav-karna/303_Texter

## Why?
Because I don't want to be in the dark for when this legend of a prof posts his messages to the public.

## What to do
Run botScript.sh in your terminal and leave it running.
Notifies you every 2 hours (Changeable within botScript.sh) if there is a new message or not.
