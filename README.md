# comp251-notificationBot
Notificiation bot for [COMP251](http://luc.devroye.org/material20.html) at McGill University so that I am notified whenever a new message is posted.
Inspiration drawn from [303_Texter by Gaurav Karna](https://github.com/gaurav-karna/303_Texter).

## Why
Because I don't want to be in the dark for when this legend of a prof posts his messages.

## How
Run botScript.sh in your terminal and leave it running.
Notifies you every 2 hours (Changeable within botScript.sh) if there is a new message.
